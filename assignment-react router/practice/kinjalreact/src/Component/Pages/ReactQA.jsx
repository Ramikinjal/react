                <h2 className='bg-info bg-gradient'>What is React Js?</h2>
                <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.
                    <br />  It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
                    <br />A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchanged DOM elements.
                    <br />React is well-suited for developing single-page applications (SPAs). A single-page application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page, rather than loading entire new pages from the server. React's component-based architecture, along with its ability to efficiently manage and update the Virtual DOM, makes it particularly effective for building SPAs.
                    <br />React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.

                <p>NPM, the Node package manager is used for managing and sharing the packages for either React or Angular. NPM will be installed along with Nodejs. Node. js can be downloaded and installed from the official NodeJs website.
                    <br />
                    Node package manager (npm) is a package manager and a software register but it's also a place where developers can find, build and manage code packages. Right now, npm contains over 800,000 packages for various applications, from front-end and robotics to mobile apps.

                    High Server Load: Using Node JS with React can help in handling requests and maintaining server load balance. JSON APIs: You can easily build JSON APIs for your application using Node JS. The reusability of the code enables sharing within React JS.</p>
                <h2 className='bg-info bg-gradient'>What is CLI command In React Js?</h2>
                <p>In React.js development, the Command Line Interface (CLI) plays a crucial role in managing various aspects of a React project. The most commonly used CLI tool for React is "Create React App" (CRA). CRA is an officially supported tool by the React team that helps you set up a new React project with a sensible default configuration. It abstracts away a lot of the configuration and build setup, allowing developers to focus on writing React code.
                    <br />  Here's how you can use the Create React App CLI to create a new React project: <br />
                    <b>npm install -g create-react-app
                    </b> <br /> <b>npx create-react-app my-react-app
                    </b>
                </p>
                <h2 className='bg-info bg-gradient'>What is Components in React Js?</h2>
                <p>React code is made of entities called components.These components are modular and reusable.
                    <br />React applications typically consist of many layers of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM using the React DOM library. <br />When rendering a component, values are passed between components through props (short for "properties"). Values internal to a component are called its state.
                    <br />
                    The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through <b>function components</b>  and <b>class components</b>.</p>

                <p>
                    To install React.js on Windows, Linux, or any operating system, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. Here are the general steps for installation on Windows and Linux: <br />
                    Install Node.js and npm: <br />

                    Download the Windows Installer (.msi) for Node.js from the official website: Node.js Downloads
                    Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js and npm. <br />
                    Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell: <br />

                    To check if Node.js and npm are installed, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

                    <br />Checking NPM Version:
                    <br />  Once Node.js and npm are installed, you can check the version of npm using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
                    <br /> <b>npm -v</b>

                </p>

                <h2 className='bg-info bg-gradient'> Explain Life cycle in Class Component and functional component with Hooks</h2>
                <p>
                    In React, components are the building blocks of a user interface. There are two main types of components: class components and functional components. Both types of components have lifecycle methods or hooks that allow you to perform actions at different stages of the component's existence. In this response, I'll provide an overview of the lifecycle methods for both class components and hooks for functional components. <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>Class Components:</b>
                    Class components in React have a set of lifecycle methods that are invoked at different points during the component's life cycle. The lifecycle can be divided into three main phases: <br />
                    <br />
                    <b> Mounting:</b>
                    <br />
                    <b> constructor():</b>  This is called when an instance of the component is being created. It is often used for initializing state and binding event handlers.
                    <br />
                    <b> render():</b>  This method is responsible for rendering the component. It must be implemented in every class component.
                    <br />
                    <b> componentDidMount():</b>   Invoked immediately after a component is inserted into the DOM. It's a good place to perform side effects like network requests.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b> Updating:</b>
                    <br />
                    shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): This method is called before rendering when new props or state are received. It allows you to control whether the component should update or not.
                    <br />
                    <b>render(): </b>  The component is re-rendered.
                    <br />
                    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Invoked immediately after updating occurs. It's a good place to perform side effects based on the changed props or state.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>  Unmounting:</b>
                    <br />
                    <b> componentWillUnmount(): </b> Invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. It's a good place to clean up resources or subscriptions.
                    <br />
                    <b>  Functional Components with Hooks:</b>

                    Functional components can now use hooks to manage state and side effects, allowing them to have similar lifecycle functionality. The key hooks are:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b> Mounting:</b>
                    <br />
                    <b> useState:</b>  Hook for adding state to functional components.
                    <br />
                    <b> useEffect</b> (() &#123; { /* effect */}, []): Hook for performing side effects in function components. The empty dependency array [] ensures that the effect runs only once after the initial render, simulating componentDidMount.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b> Updating:</b>
                    <br />
                    <b> useState:</b>  Continues to be used for managing state.
                    <br />
                    <b> useEffect</b>
                    (() &#123; { /* effect */}, [dependencies]): The effect runs when any of the dependencies change, simulating the behavior of componentDidUpdate.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b> Unmounting:</b>
                    <br />

                    {/* useEffect(() &#123; { return () &#123; { /* cleanup */}; }, []): The cleanup function inside useEffect will be called when the component is unmounted, simulating the behavior of componentWillUnmount.</p>
                <br />
